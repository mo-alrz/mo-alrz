### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub Profile
I am Mohamad and I am interested in everything about data analytics and machine learning systems. I am currently enrolled in a Master's program in IT for Business Data Analytics at IBS University in Budapest, Hungary. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, and I appreciate the opportunity to study in such a dynamic and culturally rich environment. My greatest hobbies are listening to music, watching movies and immersing myself in nature through activities like hiking and camping.
Here, you can find a compilation of all the projects and achievements I've worked on over the past year.
